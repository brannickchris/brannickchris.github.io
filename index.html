        <p class="words">I am currently in the proccess of learning to code to hopefully start a
            career as a software engineer. This is my very first website I have ever 
            made using what I learned in the first few weeks on 
            <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">codecademy</a>. It is definitely 
            a work in process.
